# Homework 1
My task was to implement the eshell, which supports the shell operations of process execution, pipeline,
sequential execution and subshell. In addition to these operations, parallel execution should also be
supported. The eshell should take its inputs line by line like a regular shell and wait for the termination
of every process that is being executed before accepting any new commands.

# Homework 2
I want to simulate cars following predetermined paths containing RCs. The RCs regulate
the flow of traffic based on their rules. Normal roads will enable transfer between RCs. The
RCs are all connected, and cars can travel between them freely with no traffic. The travel
time between connectors will be provided for each car. There are three types of RC:
Narrow Bridge, Ferry and Crossroads.
